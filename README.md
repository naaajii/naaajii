## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

### whoami?
#### I'm Naji & undergraduate CS student currently in my fifth semester.

### what do I do?
#### I mainly work on Angular projects focused on front-end development, usually implementing new features into existing codebases, creating reuseable libraries that we integrate on new projects and bugs. I also get to work on Next & React with Node on backend occasionally.

### goals?
#### I am looking to forward to improve on my DSA, better online presence and concepts for back-end development through out this year.
